# Climate Chamber Control Interface

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a web-based interface that allows users to control a climate chamber. The interface provides functionalities to monitor and adjust temperature.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of climate chamber conditions
- Control temperature using a graph based approach
- Mocking climate chamber and sensors if no physical chamber is available
- **WIP** Logging and reporting of climate chamber data

## Installation
To install and run the interface locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bergskenop/FlaskSensorInterfaceV3.git
    cd FlaskSensorInterfaceV3
    ```

2. **Install dependencies: Not yet implemented**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You can monitor and control the climate chamber settings through the web interface.
